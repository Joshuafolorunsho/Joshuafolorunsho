Hi. Iâ€™m Joshua, a frontend web developer from Kogi state, Nigeria. I have been developing web applications for the last 1 year. I'm super passionate about development and how the web works in general.

A little more... I love to share what I know through teaching. I specialize in helping others learn how to code and I believe anything can be overcome through commitment and hardwork. I'm always up for new things.
From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. When not creating websites, I like to play video games.
